# snippet generator

[Snippet generator](https://snippet-generator.app/) is a tiny React app to help you create [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and Atom snippets.

I built it for fun. It is hosted on Netlify for free (thanks, Netlify). The only thing that I pay money for is a domain name (snippet-generator.app). If you enjoy using the snippet generator, [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pawelgrzybek).

Enjoy!
